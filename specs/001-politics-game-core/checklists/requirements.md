# Specification Quality Checklist: Politics Game Core

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Constitution Alignment

- [x] Tradeoffs are mandatory (FR-003, FR-004)
- [x] Ideological neutrality enforced (FR-010)
- [x] Systems over individuals (FR-014 - institutional mechanics)
- [x] Imperfect information (FR-011)
- [x] Delayed consequences (FR-004 - 30% delayed effects)
- [x] Multiple victory paths (FR-009)
- [x] Coopetition dynamics (FR-005, FR-006, FR-012)
- [x] Educational pillar (FR-007, FR-008)
- [x] Real-time multiplayer (FR-001, FR-002)

## Validation Status

**Result**: PASS

All checklist items verified. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

## Notes

- Specification aligns with all 17 constitution principles
- 5 user stories cover the complete game loop from joining to winning/losing
- 14 functional requirements are testable and charter-compliant
- 10 success criteria provide measurable validation targets
- No clarifications needed - reasonable defaults applied based on charter guidance
