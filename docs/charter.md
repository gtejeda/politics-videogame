# Politics Board Game - Design Charter

> **North Star:** "This game models politics as a system of constrained choices where power, ideology, and institutions interact through tradeoffs rather than morality."

---

## I. Core Governing Principles (Non-Negotiables)

### 1. Ideological Neutrality, Not False Balance

The game must model reality, not "equalize" outcomes.

- Left-leaning and right-leaning policies are both valid strategic paths
- Outcomes are determined by context, timing, and tradeoffs, not moral labeling
- Policies are never marked as "good" or "bad"—only as effective or ineffective under conditions

**Design rule:** No card, rule, or mechanic may imply moral superiority of an ideology.

### 2. Tradeoffs Are Mandatory

Every decision must solve something and create pressure elsewhere.

Examples:
- Welfare expansion → social stability ↑, budget pressure ↑
- Deregulation → economic growth ↑, inequality risk ↑
- Strong security → stability ↑, civil liberty pressure ↑

**Design rule:** Any policy without a cost is removed or redesigned.

### 3. Systems Over Individuals

Politics is primarily institutional, not heroic.

- Players do not "become" leaders with special powers
- Institutions (legislature, courts, markets, public opinion) shape outcomes
- Individuals matter only through systemic leverage

**Design rule:** No single card or move may bypass institutional constraints.

### 4. Information Is Imperfect but Not Arbitrary

Players must operate with partial information, but never randomness without logic.

Uncertainty comes from:
- Public opinion volatility
- External shocks
- Delayed consequences
- Randomness is explainable, not chaotic

**Design rule:** If randomness exists, players must understand why it exists.

### 5. Consequences Are Often Delayed

Real policy effects are rarely immediate.

- Short-term gains may trigger long-term instability
- Some benefits only emerge after multiple rounds
- Reversing policy has costs

**Design rule:** At least 30–40% of policies must have delayed effects.

## II. Educational Integrity Principles

### 6. Mechanics Teach, Not Text

Players learn politics by playing, not reading.

Rules embody concepts like:
- Checks and balances
- Budget constraints
- Coalition building
- Voter incentives

**Design rule:** If a rule can teach a concept, flavor text must not replace it.

### 7. Ideologies Are Toolkits, Not Identities

Left and right are collections of policy levers, not personalities.

- Players can mix ideologies
- There is no permanent ideological lock-in
- Pragmatism is allowed—and sometimes rewarded

**Design rule:** The game must allow "impure" ideological strategies.

### 8. No Utopias

There is no perfect equilibrium state.

- Every society has persistent tension
- Stability ≠ prosperity ≠ freedom
- Optimization always increases risk elsewhere

**Design rule:** Endgame states must always show unresolved tensions.

## III. Gameplay & Fun Safeguards

### 9. Conflict Without Villains

Competition emerges from resource scarcity and institutional friction, not evil actors.

- Players compete for influence, legitimacy, or policy control
- No player is "the bad guy" by design

**Design rule:** Conflict must arise even if all players act rationally.

### 10. Multiple Paths to Victory

Winning should reflect different political philosophies.

Examples:
- Economic dominance
- Social cohesion
- Institutional resilience
- Global influence
- Long-term stability

**Design rule:** No single metric can define victory alone.

### 11. Failure Is Instructive

Losing should teach why.

Clear post-game debrief indicators:
- Budget collapse
- Legitimacy crisis
- Institutional paralysis
- Overextension

**Design rule:** Every loss condition must be traceable to identifiable choices.

## IV. Development Guidelines

### 12. Start with a Minimal Political Model

Before adding content, define:
1. Core resources (e.g. budget, legitimacy, stability, growth)
2. Core institutions
3. Core feedback loops

Only then add:
- Ideological flavor
- Events
- Special rules

### 13. Playtest for Bias, Not Just Balance

During testing, explicitly ask:
- Does one ideology feel "safer"?
- Are certain policies always dominant?
- Are consequences believable?

**Design rule:** A mechanic that "feels" biased must be justified or removed—even if balanced.

### 14. Design for Expansion Without Rewrites

Your base game should support:
- New countries
- New eras
- New institutions
- New ideological movements

**Design rule:** No expansion should invalidate base mechanics.

## Charter Compliance Checklist

When reviewing any game element, verify:

- [ ] Does it have a meaningful tradeoff?
- [ ] Is it ideologically neutral in framing?
- [ ] Does it work through institutions, not around them?
- [ ] If random, is the randomness explainable?
- [ ] Does it avoid implying a "correct" answer?
- [ ] Can it support future expansion?
